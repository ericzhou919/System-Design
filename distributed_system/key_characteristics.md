# Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

## Scalability
- The capability of a system to grow and manage increased demand.
- Continuously evolve to support growing amount of work.
- Horizontal scaling: by adding more servers into the pool of resources.
- Vertical scaling: by adding more resource (CPU, RAM, storage, etc) to an existing server.
  
## Reliability
- Refers to the ability of the system to continue functioning correctly even if one or more components fail.
- Use redundant components, such as multiple servers or storage devices, that can take over if a primary component fails.
- Another approach is to replicate data and workloads across multiple computers.
  
## Availability   
- Refers to the ability of a system to be operable and able to perform its intended tasks.  
- An available system is not necessarily reliable.

## Efficiency
- Refers to the ability of the system to use its resources effectively in order to perform its intended tasks.
- Latency: response time, the delay to obtain the first piece of data.
- Bandwidth: throughput, amount of data delivered in a given time.
